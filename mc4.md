# Mini Challenge 4

## Password reset complete

## Acceptance Criteria

0. Test the current password reset flow manually, taking note of each template in the process so you can decide what to add on the following template files.
1. Password reset form (type in email address): "registration/password_reset_form.html"
2. Password reset email body template: "registration/password_reset_email.html"
3. Password reset email subject line: "registration/password_reset_subject.txt"
4. Password reset email form confirmation: "registration/password_reset_done.html"
5. Password reset form (new password selection): "registration/password_reset_confirm.html"
6. Password reset complete (plain text confirmation): "registration/password_reset_complete.html"

## Bonus
If you still have an unordered list for your list.html, change it so that instead, a bootstrap card is generated for each post.
Consider truncating the post's body to display a subset of characters (maybe the first 128) instead of the entire post body (which can be up to 1GB of pure text!)
